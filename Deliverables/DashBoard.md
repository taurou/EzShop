# Project Dashboard

The dashboard collects the key measures about the project.
To be used to control the project, and compare with others. These measures will not be used to grade the project. <br>
We consider two phases: <br>
-New development: From project start (april 5) to delivery of version 0 (release 0, may 28) <br>
-Corrective Maintenance: fix of defects (if any)  (may 28 to june 4)   <br>
Report effort figures from the timesheet or timesheetCR document, compute size from the source code.

## New development (release 0  -- april 5 to may 28)
| Measure| Value |
|---|---|
|effort E |246H|
|size S   |2028|
|productivity = S/E |8.3|
|defects before release D_before  |8|




## Corrective Maintenance (release 1 -- may 28 to june 4)

| Measure | Value|
|---|---|
| effort for non-quality ENQ  |1H|
| effort for non quality, relative = ENQ / E |1/246 = 0.4%|
|defects after release D  |5|
| defects before release vs defects after release = D/D_before |5/8|
|defect density = D/S|5/2028|
|overall productivity = S/(E + ENQ)|2028/(247)=8.2|
